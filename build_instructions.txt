# Build Instructions for Real-Time Meeting Assistant

## Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.11** installed.
2. **FFmpeg** installed and added to system PATH (Required for Whisper).
   - Download from: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
3. **VB-Audio Virtual Cable** installed.
   - Download from: https://vb-audio.com/Cable/
   - Set "CABLE Output" as your Input Device in the App Settings.
   - Set "CABLE Input" as the Output Device in your Meeting App (Zoom/Teams).
   - Use Windows Sound Control Panel to "Listen to this device" on CABLE Output if you want to hear the audio too.

## Installation

1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. Install PyTorch with CUDA support (for GPU acceleration):
   - Check your CUDA version (e.g., 11.8 or 12.1).
   - Run command from https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
   - Example (CUDA 12.1):
     ```bash
     pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
     ```

3. Install other dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the App

```bash
python main.py
```

## Packaging with PyInstaller

To create a standalone .exe:

1. Install PyInstaller:
   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```

2. Run the build command:
   ```bash
   pyinstaller --noconfirm --onedir --windowed --name "MeetingAssistant" --add-data "config.json;." --hidden-import="whisper" --hidden-import="pyside6" main.py
   ```

3. The output will be in the `dist/MeetingAssistant` folder.

## Troubleshooting

- **Whisper Error**: If you get "FileNotFoundError: [WinError 2] The system cannot find the file specified", ensure FFmpeg is in your PATH.
- **CUDA Not Found**: Ensure you installed the specific CUDA version of PyTorch. Run `python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"` to verify.
- **Overlay Not Click-Through**: Ensure "Lock Overlay" is checked in Settings.
